# Welcome to the Team!

**Sponsers:**

- GitKraken: Free access for our team
- Vercel OSS: We are a part of Vercel's Open Soure ... (no one knows what that last S stands for. If you do, please do tell us). In the OSS, Vercel gave us monthly credits that we use on Vercel tools for our project.

We're excited to have you here! This app first started out as a hackathon project and has now grown into something more. Now, our apprenticeship team is working together to refine and launch it for public use. To not overwhelm new people, I decided to create this documentation to help you get things set up. So, let's take this one step at a time and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me (Alex) on discord.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, let's start with step 1... getting this project onto your computer.

If you prefer the old school dinosaur method, go [here](./cloneWithGit.md) to view how to clone the repo using regular git. But, if you have GitKraken then go [here](./cloneWithGitKraken.md) to learn how to clone using the GitKraken GUI.

> Note: While using regular Git is perfectly fine and gets the job done, I highly recommend trying out the GitKraken GUI. Learning new tools is important because technology evolves quickly, and being adaptable makes you more efficient and valuable in real-world environments. Companies often prefer modern workflows that save time, so getting comfortable with new tools will help you stay ahead.

> Plus, GitKraken sponsors us and provides free access to our team! Just ask us in Discord and we'll get you set up.

## Step 2: Familiarize Yourself With The Project

It's really important to understand the project structure before you start working. This will make your tasks easier and help you avoid feeling lost or overwhelmed. Take some time to learn about how the project is organized [here](./projectStructure.md). This documentation will guide you through our setup and explain why we do things a certain way. In real jobs, every company has its own standards and workflows, so being adaptable is a key skill for any engineer.

## Step 3: Start Your First Ticket

Once you have some understanding of the project structure, let's go ahead and dive into your first ticket! Your first ticket will be something small and manageable so you can get comfortable without feeling overwhelmed. This first task is designed to help you get familiar with the codebase, see how we write our code, and learn our workflow for creating branches and submitting pull requests (PRs). Take your time with it—use this opportunity to understand our standards and ask questions if anything is unclear. You can find a guide on how to work on your first ticket [here](./startTicket.md).

## Database & Backend

We are using **Supabase** as our database and backend service. Supabase is an easy to use PostgreSQL BaaS (backend as a service). We use it for authentication as well. Currently, we only have google auth set up, but are hoping to add more in the future. To learn more about how our database is structured and how the data looks, check out the documentation [here](./backend.md).

## Tips & Tricks

- Don't hesitate to ask questions in Discord—we're here to help! When it comes to writing code, though, we encourage you to challenge yourself first. Try to solve problems on your own for a set amount of time before reaching out. If you're still stuck after that, then ask for help. This approach builds your self-learning and problem-solving skills, which are essential for your growth as an engineer.
- When Shashi asks you a question in your PR, it's usually to encourage you to think differently about your code and find ways to improve it. Take his feedback as an opportunity to learn and refine your work. If you're unsure about what he means, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Shashi likes to challenge us to think deeper, which sets us up for future success. Thanks to his feedback, many of us now approach tasks from multiple perspectives.
- Take things one step at a time. Diving straight into work can often lead to wasted time and confusion. Instead, pause, take a deep breath, and break each task into manageable steps. Working methodically will help you become faster and more efficient in the long run.
